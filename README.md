# libft
The goal of this project is to code its own library of functions in C, with a base of usual functions and by adding functions that can be useful for my next projects.
--> See subject.pdf for more details on the behavior of those functions.

## How to use the lib

```
git clone https://github.com/M-Laventure/libft libft
cd libft
make all
```

It will create a `libft.a` library you can link to any of your projects.
